<h1>The New Zealand Housing Crisis</h1>

<h2>What Is This Issue?</h2>
</div>

<div class="Intro">
    <p>The goal of this website is to bring much-needed attention to the growing affordable housing crisis in Auckland, New Zealand, and to shed light on its profound impact on our community. As Auckland continues to grow—becoming New Zealand's largest and most populous city—residents from all walks of life are facing escalating housing affordability challenges.

With rising property prices and limited affordable housing options, many Aucklanders, including myself, are struggling to find safe, suitable, and affordable places to live. This crisis affects everyone, but it hits families, young people, and low-income workers the hardest, forcing them out of the housing market or into overcrowded living conditions.

This platform aims to increase understanding of the complexities surrounding the housing shortage, from skyrocketing rent to the scarcity of affordable homes. Through a combination of personal stories, researched facts, and shared insights, I hope to highlight how deeply this issue impacts not only the most vulnerable but the entire Auckland community.

One organization that plays a vital role in addressing this crisis is Rosmini College. By fostering a community-driven approach, Rosmini amplifies the voices of those affected by the housing shortage and advocates for local government policy changes. This website integrates Rosmini's outreach programs and initiatives to help encourage meaningful conversations and solutions.

Ultimately, my mission is to inspire collective action. By bringing attention to this issue and promoting dialogue, I hope to spark change and encourage both the local government and the wider community to take steps toward addressing the affordable housing crisis in Auckland.</p>
